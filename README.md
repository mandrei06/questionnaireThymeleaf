Requirements
--------------

INTRO:<br>
Create a questionnaire app. The user will see the questions one by one. At the end, they will get how much afinity they have to implement blockchain into each of these 5 verticals<br>
	- DATA<br>
	- LOGISTICS<br>
	- IDENTITY VALIDATION<br>
	- FIDELIZATION<br>
	- PAYMENTS<br>

Sample Questions:<br>
	- How big is your company?<br>
		- 0-10<br>
		- 10-100<br>
		- >100<br>
	- How many users you have?<br>
		- 0<br>
		- 10-100<br>
		- 100-1000<br>
		- >1000<br>

IMPORTANT NOTES:<br>
	- Assume the number of questions to be arbitrary. The client could add or remove questions at any time. You don't have to create a front-end for that, they will do it using command line.
	<br>- We need to store the email to contact him/her later.
	<br>- (Ignore this if you don't have time) The same user cannot use the form more than once. Use his email for authorization.
	<br>- There are no multiple versions of the form. EVERY question in the database will be shown to the user.
